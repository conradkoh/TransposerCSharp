When the evil one
Comes against you
To fill your heart with fear
You can trust in God
He will never leave you
He promised to be near
You can lift up a song
In the midst of the war
For the battle is mine




Sing, Sing, Sing
Sing, Sing, Sing


For the Lord is good
And His mercy endureth forever
For the Lord is good
And His mercy endureth forever
Forever and ever
